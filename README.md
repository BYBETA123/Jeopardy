# Jeopardy (Balanced* Edition)

## What is this project

This project is an effort to balance the Jeopardy scoring system, making the common methods to advance ahead less powerful by rewarding the players who are falling behind with more points

### The new scoring system

The scoring system is adjusted such that the teams that are falling behind will be able to catch up

This table, although untested is the current layout

| Points | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
|:------:|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|100|100|150|200|250|
|200|200|250|300|350|
|300|300|350|400|450|
|400|400|450|500|550|
|500|500|550|600|650|
